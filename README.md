# live-listing

Every year, move-in and move-out periods generate massive waste; perfectly good household items get tossed to the landfill, while new students buy brand-new replacements, contributing to overconsumption. LiveListing solves this by directly connecting students moving in with those moving out, making the process more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective. How does it work? LiveListing offers real-time messaging, item search, and location- and time-based recommendations to help students find exactly what they need, when and where they need it. 

The project's backend was developed using Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Firebase. The project's frontend was created with React Native, TypeScript, and Expo.

To run the app in Expo Go, navigate to the frontend directory and run ``npx expo start``.
