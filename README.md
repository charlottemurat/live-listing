# live-listing

Every year, move-in and move-out periods generate massive waste: perfectly good household items get tossed to the landfill, while new students buy brand-new replacements, contributing to overconsumption. LiveListing solves this by directly connecting students moving in with those moving out, making the process more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective. How does it work? LiveListing offers real-time messaging, item search, and location- and time-based recommendations to help students find exactly what they need, when and where they need it. 

To run the app in Expo Go, navigate to the frontend directory and run <mark>npx expo start</mark>.
